### Hi there 👋

I'm Jonathan, fullstack developer with 2 years of experience, based in Paris.

My Github is mostly private (I know it's baaad... one day I will clean all my old repos 👨‍🎓), but in the mean time, you can find below a few real projects I did for real clients these last few months 🚀:

- [Atelier Tribu de Paris](https://ateliertribu.fr) > NextJS, Ruby on Rails, Strapi CMS (Docker)
- [Atelier Musée Chana Orloff](https://chana-orloff.org) > NextJS, Strapi CMS (Docker)

Feel free to reach out!
